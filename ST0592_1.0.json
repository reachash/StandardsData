  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profile: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Marinas and boatyards support the yachting and boating sectors, which are key areas of the leisure marine industry both nationally and internationally. Marinas include coastal or inland, river and waterway docks, or basins with moorings and services for vessels. Boatyards are waterside locations where vessels are built, maintained, docked, or stored.&#160;The revenues from marinas, moorings and associated activities amount to in excess of &#163;222 million a year.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Marina and Boatyard Operatives deliver a variety of operations and services that include vessel handling such as lifting, launching, high pressure washing off and the storage of vessels ashore and the berthing and movement of vessels on the water in accordance with company policy. Operatives must work in a safe manner, complying with relevant legislation, regulations, codes of practice and other information and guidance. This will help ensure the safety of vessel users, staff and visitors, along with ensuring the safety of vessels and property within the marina /boatyard confines. In performing their role, Marina and Boatyard Operatives use a range of equipment; they engage with customers, other staff, external contractors/suppliers, and visitors, and this is undertaken in a polite and helpful manner. Marina and Boatyard Operatives conduct regular maintenance activities and checks around the marina/boatyard and this may include work on pontoon systems, buildings, storage cradles, along with maintenance and checks within public areas and wider facility buildings. &#160;Depending on the size of the marina/boatyard, operatives report to the site manager or departmental line manager. Certain Marina and Boatyard Operative tasks require team working, for example boat lifting. Operatives are expected to work under their own initiative and can undertake lone working outside of normal office hours, acting as the sole representative for the site/organisation.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Marina and Boatyard Operatives may undertake specialisms in retail, fuel, rigging, or lock and bridge operation. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALL the core knowledge, skills and behaviours detailed below must be met together with ONE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;specialised&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; option detailed on Page 4.&#160; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING - All Marina and Boatyard Operatives will know and understand the: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\r\n&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORE SKILLS - All Marina and Boatyard Operatives will be able to: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Role and activities of marinas and boatyards, the services provided by them and their place in the marine leisure industry, both nationally and internationally.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Discuss the industry and how marinas and boatyards support design, production, employment and tourism etc.&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Risks and hazards in the workplace and how to implement safe working practices taking into account current Health and Safety legislation.
