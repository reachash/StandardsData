  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the rail industry in the United Kingdom; the infrastructure (track, signalling, bridges, tunnels, stations, and depots) and rail services (trains). Railway operations managers are employed in train operating companies (TOCs), freight operating companies (FOCs) and rail infrastructure operators, including Network Rail, managing key operational areas, including, control, safety, performance, operating capacities, signalling, depots and stations. Because of the diverse operational requirements associated with this occupation, a railway operations manager may be required to work in person at various locations and sites, as well as remote working, with shift work sometimes required, particularly where infrastructure and rail services operate during unsociable hours. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to contribute to safe, efficient, and effective operation of the rail infrastructure and rail services by leading and managing operational teams. Railway operations managers typically liaise with internal and external stakeholders, lead teams of technical experts, lead planning and risk management activities and ensure operational compliance with industry legislation and regulations. Railway operations managers will be required to make decisions that will directly influence the management of the infrastructure and rail services, with a focus on continuous improvement being at the core of this approach. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide variety of internal and external stakeholders. Primarily they will be required to work with members of their immediate team to ensure safe operation of the infrastructure and rail services, for example, signallers, train drivers, station operations staff. Typical stakeholders outside of their immediate team could include other operations managers, customers and trade union officials. Although managing an operational team is a key aspect of this occupation there may also be times when it is necessary to work independently. Railway operations managers must be able to demonstrate business and commercial acumen, collaborating with stakeholders &amp;amp; industry bodies as well as front line staff to achieve organisational objectives. Railway operations managers will also need to effectively engage with their operational teams to guide the principles of broader business implications including recruitment, policies, and training for the wider rail workforce. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for maintaining safe and compliant railway operations while also ensuring performance targets are achieved. Managing operational risks will be a key factor in achieving this which may require a wide range of performance data and information to be analysed. In addition, the outcomes of these analysis activities will be used when reviewing and validating solutions against existing services, business requirements and contracts, and customer standards. Railway operations managers may sometimes encounter degraded travel conditions, unexpected incidents or emergency situations that can be extremely challenging and require the railway operations manager to analyse the situation and identify and communicate appropriate solutions.&lt;/p&gt;",
