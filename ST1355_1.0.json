  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the manufacturing supply chain of high value and strategically critical industries including automotive, aerospace, construction, military, renewable energy and general industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to set-up, configure, operate and monitor complex high value machinery that enables components to be mass produced in the most economically viable way. The process includes a series of steps using uniquely designed tooling and processes such as drawing, extrusion, upsetting, heading, piercing and trimming in order to make the completed component. The setter technician will interpret complex engineering drawings and diagrams to enable them to set up the machine appropriately. They are responsible for the set up, running, maintenance and management of the machinery and process to ensure that production meets tolerances and quality standards. They would also be expected to take part in the development of new products and have a considerable involvement in quality assurance activities and process efficiency improvements. Typical products produced using this process will include bolts, nuts, screws, bushes, rivets, solid and hollow formed parts. The cold forming process is extremely efficient compared to other manufacturing processes and results in significantly less product waste being produced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with managers or supervisors, technical or production personnel, purchasing, maintenance, quality and other operatives on the shop floor. A cold forming setter technician will typically spend most of their time working on the factory floor, with some time spent away from this environment if working on new product evaluation and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the complete set-up, operation and management of high value cold forming manufacturing equipment capable of high-volume production while meeting customer specifications and achieving consistently high tolerances and quality and environmental standards. They will also autonomously carry out a range of maintenance, quality assurance, process monitoring and adjustments, to ensure the machinery is operating at required efficiency and accuracy levels. A cold forming setter technician will work as part of a wider manufacturing team, however they will usually work autonomously and will exercise considerable responsibility and judgement on machine operation with a high-level of personal decision making and influence on the process. Depending on the size of the organisation, a cold forming machine setter technician would typically report to the production manager, supervisor or engineer. They will have an understanding of secondary operation processes such as thread rolling, pointing, fillet radius rolling as well as follow-on processes such as cleaning, heat treatment and coating. They need to work safely at all times taking into consideration the equipment being used and the working environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
